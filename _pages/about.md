Hi! I’m a second‑year PhD student in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html) at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), and I’m fortunate to be advised by Associate Professor [Chang Xu](http://changxu.xyz/).

My research focuses on the intersection of machine perception (generative AI) and privacy-preserving generation. Specifically, I develop robust privacy safeguards for state-of-the-art generative models to enhance the novelty and diversity of outputs while also preventing the unauthorized replication or disclosure of sensitive and proprietary training data. This work aims to protect both end-users and model developers from legal and ethical complications. Central to this effort is a dual objective: ensuring strong protections against legal and ethical violations, such as those involving copyrighted material or sensitive medical records, while maintaining the highest possible fidelity and performance in generative capabilities.
